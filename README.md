## Features of the design and preparation of the text for publication
Modern online publications are paying more and more attention to the high-quality preparation of their texts for web publishing. The text must comply with a certain code style, adopted on this particular resource. The rules for the design of the text may be different:
- long dash characters, instead of "minus" or "hyphen",
- french quotation marks (herringbone) instead of English (as commas),
- date values should not be carried over to the next line,
- you need to remove all unnecessary duplicate spaces,
- for a web publication, it is sometimes better to display characters using HTML-entyties
and so on. Usually, this work in an online publication (and not only) is handled by a proofreader (if the author admits, of course, such flaws), sometimes an editor. However, the implementation of many rules of text formatting can be automated and this task is served by typographers.
